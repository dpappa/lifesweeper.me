            <p>Our story starts with Mike watching TV. The show is called "Inside Combat Rescue." In the episode,
               American soliders in Afghanistan are on a search and rescue mission. The mission takes them to an active minefield.
                 Unfortunately, the team is stuck waiting for ground forces to sweep for mines before the helicopter can land.
                 Time is critical when a soldier is bleeding out.</p>
            <p> Here we will have references to Mike's first idea conception. 
            Maybe links to video clips on youtube, and how we all first precieved it. </p>

          <p>Our first few designs looked like a lunch box with treads. We had tossed around the idea of mounting the metal detector under the body of the car vs right in front of it.</p>  
          <p>Originally, the intent was to control the car through an Android application. The idea was shelved due to time constraints. Instead we opted for web based control.</p>
          <p>The marking mechanism was originally designed around the use of spray paint. Using different types of paints, we could achieve different goals, such as glow in the dark and infrared.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
          <p>After some thinking, we decided to revist some of our ideas. Some of the biggest ideas we revisted were the marking mechanism, the metal detector placement, and how to control the vehicle.</p>
          <p>We took inspiration from real life and developed the boom arm to mimic the action of manually sweeping mines. The boom arm will hold the metal detector in front of the vehicle.</p>
          <p>The marking mechanism got scrapped for a more mechanized system. Using a motor attached to the boom arm, glow sticks are dropped where the metal detector is positioned.</p>
