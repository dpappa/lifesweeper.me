          We are currently enrolled at the University of Toledo, in the college of 
          Engineering Technology. </p>

         <!-- <p>The project is to build a remote controlled mine sweeping robot for use in combat situations.
           This robot will alleviate the need for manual mine sweepers in the battlefield, reducing the 
           possibility of further injuries and save lives. Our main focus is on portability and ease of use. 
           Our initial concept is to control the systems with Arduino micro controllers, which will be mounted 
           to a custom RC vehicle, all while relaying  a video feed back to the controller.</p> -->
